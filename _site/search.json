All able-bodied adults are required to work a minimum of 80 hours per month, which can be broken down into roughly 20 hours per week. This can be either paid or unpaid work, and more information on this requirement can be found on the [Department of Social Services](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/calfresh/abawd#:~:text=People%20who%20are%20ABAWDs%20must,%2C%20and%20in%2Dkind%20work.) website. If you are an student, you may be enrolled in at least 6 academic units or more (equivalent to 18+ hours per week of academic workload) rather than having a paid/unpaid job. For more information on student eligibility, see the [College Student Eligibility](https://www.csuchico.edu/calfresh/basics/college-student-eligibility.shtml) requirements on Chico State's website.\n# \n# The below graphs breaks down if a person meets the workload requirements based solely on one of the following criteria:\n# \n# -   Academic workload - enrolled in 6 or more units (18 or more hours).\n# -   Paid Workload - working 20+ weekly hours at a paid position.\n# -   Unpaid Workload - working 20+ weekly hours at a unpaid position.\n# -   Total Workload - working 20+ weekly hours in total (combination of academic, paid, and unpaid).\n# \n# *Note: people with a workload of 0 hours were included in the graph and analysis.*\n# \n# tmp &lt;- tmp2\n# tmp &lt;- tmp %&gt;% mutate(student=factor(ifelse(is.na(q18), NA, \n#                                             ifelse(q18 &gt;= 6, \"Eligible\", \"Not Eligible\")),\n#                                      levels=c(\"Not Eligible\", \"Eligible\")),\n#                       paid=factor(ifelse(is.na(paid_work_hours), NA, \n#                                          ifelse(paid_work_hours &gt;= 20, \"Eligible\", \"Not Eligible\"))\n#                                   , levels=c(\"Not Eligible\", \"Eligible\")),\n#                       unpaid=factor(ifelse(is.na(unpaid_work_hours), NA, \n#                                            ifelse(unpaid_work_hours &gt;= 20, \"Eligible\", \"Not Eligible\")),\n#                                     levels=c(\"Not Eligible\", \"Eligible\")),\n#                       total=factor(ifelse(is.na(TotalHours), NA, \n#                                           ifelse(TotalHours &gt;= 20, \"Eligible\", \"Not Eligible\")), \n#                                    levels=c(\"Not Eligible\", \"Eligible\"))) %&gt;%\n#   select(student, paid, unpaid, total)\n# \n# names(tmp) &lt;- c(\"Academic Workload\", \"Paid Workload\", \"Unpaid Workload\", \"Total Workload\")\n# \n# plot_likert(tmp,\n#             grid.range = c(1.4, 1.4),\n#             wrap.legend.labels = 20,\n#             expand.grid = FALSE,\n#             values = \"sum.outside\",\n#             catcount = 2,\n#             geom.colors = c(\"#D8B365\",\"#5AB4AC\"),\n#             show.prc.sign = TRUE, reverse.scale = TRUE) + theme_bw() + theme(legend.position = \"top\")"
